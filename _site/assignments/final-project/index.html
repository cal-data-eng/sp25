</h2>
    

<p>The final project is <strong>optional</strong>; if you submit it, it will be <a href="/sp25/syllabus">10% of your final grade</a>. Given that this is both a group project and optional, there will be penalties to your final grade if you end up stop working on the project midway through (out of fairness to your team members). If you are choosing to participate, realize that you will have to follow all the way through to the end — more on this later.</p>

<p>The final project will be a multi-part group project which will ask that you complete an investigation of two data systems—one of which is PostgreSQL and the other will be a non-relational system of your choice—based on a <strong>performance benchmark</strong> (dataset, queries, and measurements) of your design.</p>

<p>If you are interested in completing this optional final project, we encourage you to skim this page and start finding groups, using the team search thread as posted on Ed. As mentioned previously, if you choose to do the project, you are making a commitment to work with your team all the way through to final project submission, so please be mindful of that.</p>

<p>You will submit a written report, where your analysis will include the following steps:</p>

<p>1.<strong>Load your dataset into PostgreSQL</strong>. Given the size of your dataset, instead of DataHub you may need to do a local installation of JupyterHub and PostgreSQL &gt; 14. More installation details to follow.</p>
<ul>
  <li>We have curated <strong>a list of suggested datasets</strong> to use for your project, but you are also welcome to select an external dataset:
    <ul>
      <li>Yelp: <a href="https://www.yelp.com/dataset">https://www.yelp.com/dataset</a>
</li>
      <li>Open Library: <a href="https://openlibrary.org/developers/dumps">https://openlibrary.org/developers/dumps</a>
</li>
      <li>Wikipedia: <a href="https://dumps.wikimedia.org/">https://dumps.wikimedia.org/</a>
        <ul>
          <li>You will likely want to start with a <a href="https://dumps.wikimedia.org/enwiki/20241020/">recent dump of English Wikipedia</a>. (<a href="https://dumps.wikimedia.org/enwiki/20241101/">https://dumps.wikimedia.org/enwiki/20241101/</a>)</li>
          <li>We <strong>do not</strong> recommend that you consider the full text/HTML dump of Wikipedia for this assignment, and only the metadata about the articles. However, you could choose to sample the text dump.</li>
          <li>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Database_download">Wikipedia maintains a guide</a> on their own data dumps.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>If you would like to “bring your own” dataset, see the section “Choosing an alternate dataset” for more information.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<ol>
  <li>
<strong>Load your dataset into a non-relational data system</strong>. Some examples could include: MongoDB, Graph databases (neo4j), Streaming databases (Flink, Kafka), key-value store (Redis, memcached), Spark, Velox, Polars, Apache Data Fusion, Ibis. Be creative here! If you need help with picking a data system, or other feedback in general, feel free to post on Ed.</li>
  <li>
<strong>Design and analyze a benchmark set of tasks</strong>. Select a representative set of 5 queries (i.e., tasks) that compare the two data systems on the following dimensions:
    <ul>
      <li>Fitness/ergonomics: Is your data system well-designed for the task? How easy is it to complete this task and/or can it even do the task? (i.e., does the system aid you in writing the queries you are trying to write)</li>
      <li>Performance: How much disk storage or memory (RAM) and time resources does each system spend to complete this task?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
<strong>Present your findings in a written report.</strong> This report could be used in an imaginary scenario where, say, a manager or labmate could use your report to determine which of two data systems to use. Your report therefore should include diagrams, code snippets, tables/visualizations (where appropriate), and broader reflections/recommendations about the usability of the systems themselves (ease of setup/debugging, etc.).
    <ul>
      <li>You are also required to submit a <strong>project checkpoint</strong>. For the checkpoint, we expect you to cover enough setup/groundwork such that you can run at least one query in PostgreSQL on your chosen dataset.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Group work requirement</strong>: You <strong>must be in a team of 3 or 4 (ideally)</strong>. If you’re looking for a group OR if you have a partial/full team, please utilize the Team Matching thread on Ed. Your team must be finalized by the checkpoint at 4/18, 5 PM PT and one member must fill out this <strong><a href="https://forms.gle/N4uGtSoGHiqy4eLLA">Final Project Team Form</a></strong>.</p>

</h2>
    

<p>The goal of this project is to create a performance benchmark to analyze and study two different systems: PostgreSQL and another system of your choice. A performance benchmark is essentially a standard set of tasks performed on a given dataset. These tasks can span both queries and updates – anything that will give you more information about how the systems work in practice.</p>

<p>Because of the open nature of this project (choice of second data system, dataset, and tasks), <strong>for this first version of the project, we suggest a default project</strong> below. However, we encourage you to explore other options beyond the default project.</p>
<h3 id="memo-suggested-default-project">
  
  
    <a href="#memo-suggested-default-project" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="memo-suggested-default-project"><svg viewbox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> <img class="emoji" title=":memo:" alt=":memo:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f4dd.png" height="20" width="20"> Suggested Default Project
  
  
</h3>
    

<p>We suggest the following choices for most project teams:</p>

<ul>
  <li>PostgreSQL</li>
  <li>Dataset: Yelp</li>
  <li>Compare to: MongoDB</li>
</ul>

<p>This default project still leaves a lot of room for your team to decide on the set of benchmark tasks. We recommend looking at <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">users</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">businesses</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">reviews</code> if you don’t know where to start. For example, each <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">user</code> has a list of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">friends</code> which could make for some interesting comparisons between SQL and NoSQL systems.</p>

<p><strong>Reducing dataset complexity</strong>: The Yelp dataset (Main, not Photos) is relatively large, about ~10GB when uncompressed. You do not <em><strong>need</strong></em> to load all of the records into your Postgres (or MongoDB) databases. We recommend <em><strong>sampling</strong></em> the Yelp dataset and/or choosing a subset of the database schema to make working with the dataset easier (see <a href="/sp25/assignments/final-project-tips">Final Project Tips</a>). In your written report, you will need to demonstrate that the reduced dataset that you construct for your workload <strong>must meet the minimum requirements</strong> listed in the Choosing an alternate dataset section below.</p>

</h3>
    

<p>If you’d like to pick a different dataset, you are welcome to do so. However, it must meet <strong>all</strong> of the following requirements:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Total uncompressed size ≥ 1GB of data</li>
  <li>Minimum of 1 million records (across all entities)</li>
</ul>

<p>If you are looking for alternate datasets, it can be helpful to pick a domain in which you have expertise or deep interest amongst your teammates.</p>

</h3>
    

<p>You’ve already gained experience with Postgres; now you must pick a <em>different</em> data system or application to explore. The data system should help you accomplish some tasks which are different from that of a typical relational database. Some examples could include: MongoDB, Graph databases (neo4j), Streaming databases (Flink, Kafka), key-value store (Redis, memcached), Spark, Velox, Polars, Apache Data Fusion, Ibis, Apache airflow, dbt. Be creative here! If you need help with picking a data system, feel free to post on Ed.</p>

<p><strong>How do you decide on a tool/system before using it?</strong>
Read the docs! Ideally, you will be able to work with and learn about a tool which has excellent documentation and for which it is easy to search for answers to questions. No one is expected to learn new tools simply by guessing the right commands; learning how to use the documentation provided will make the process much easier!</p>

<p>You should also consider picking a tool based on its <strong>fitness and ergonomics</strong> for the tasks you want to accomplish. See the Design and Analyze a Benchmark Set of Tasks for more information.</p>

</h2>
    

<p>In this assignment, you will need to decide a <strong>benchmark set of tasks</strong>. Select a representative set of 5 queries (i.e., tasks) that compare the two data system on the following dimensions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<strong>Fitness/ergonomics</strong>: Is your data system well-designed for the task? How easy is it to complete this task and/or can it even do the task? (i.e., does the system aid you in writing the queries you are trying to write)</li>
  <li>
<strong>Performance</strong>: How much disk storage or memory (RAM) and time resources does each system spend to complete this task?</li>
</ul>

<p>At least 3 of the 5 queries (if not all!) must be executable on both systems so you can say something meaningful about fitness/ergonomics and performance comparisons.</p>

<p><strong>Choosing tasks</strong>
The tasks you select should help to best demonstrate the capacities of systems you are comparing. For example, consider not just the execution time of an individual query, but the time that it took to load data in, the memory (RAM) or storage utilization of that particular system. What parameters (e.g., indexes, views, query optimization knobs) does each system provide that allow you to improve performance of a given task or workload?</p>

<p><strong>Fitness and “ergonomics”</strong>
The <strong>fitness</strong> of a tool describes how well suited a tool is to a specific task. When comparing tools, one of your tasks will be to compare their fitness for the particular problem you are trying to solve. For example, both MongoDB and PostgreSQL can store and query semi-structured data, but they take very different approaches.</p>

<p>When engineers talk about “<strong>ergonomics</strong>” (or affordances) they are referring to whether a particular tool makes it easy or intuitive to accomplish a specific task. One example: Jupyter Notebooks provide good ergonomics for exploring data. Another example: SQL databases make <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">JOIN</code>ing data convenient, but MongoDB does not.</p>

<p><strong>Comparing apples to oranges</strong>
It can be tricky to compare a RDBMS to (say) a NoSQL DB when they are <em>designed</em> to solve different problems. Think holistically about the comparisons, both for fitness, ergonomics, and performance. Ultimately, if a task cannot be implemented in one system, you should still reflect on why the task selection was a good choice, and what barriers/constraints you found in the other system.</p>

<p>You are expected to write a report that describes the tradeoffs between the two data systems you analyzed, and (perhaps more importantly) how you conducted your analysis.

You are required to show screenshots of at least one query in action on both systems.</p>

<p>You are required to submit both a checkpoint report (as part of the project checkpoint) and a final report. Please see the Deliverables section below for more details. You should use your team’s preferred tool (e.g., Overleaf or Google Docs) to write the report.</p>

<p>You must work in groups of three or four for this project. Note that you will be evaluating your group members at the end of the project: we strongly encourage you to discuss and resolve any conflicts with your group members sooner rather than later.</p>

<p>In very special circumstances (e.g., extenuating personal circumstances), we will allow students to work alone. If you believe you qualify for this exception, please email <a href="mailto:data101@berkeley.edu">data101@berkeley.edu</a> AND cc instructor(s) ASAP with relevant information/documentation. Do not assume the exception has been granted until you receive a confirmation email.</p>

<p>The checkpoint report is a relatively short report to make sure your team is on track. Your team will submit one <strong>written report</strong> to Gradescope. See the <a href="#present-your-findings">Present Your Findings</a> section for report components.</p>

<p>Your checkpoint report is <strong>expected to be at most 2 pages</strong> and could include code snippets, charts, or tables as necessary. You may choose to write your report in your team’s preferred tool (e.g., Overleaf or Google Docs)..</p>

<p>One team member will <strong>also</strong> be required to fill out the <a href="https://forms.gle/N4uGtSoGHiqy4eLLA">Final Project Team Form</a>, which confirms team composition and asks about how the project is going in general.</p>

<p>Be aware that team compositions are final: if you commit to participating in a team, you are expected to follow through on that commitment all the way to final project submission, or else you will be subject to penalties on your final grade, as described below.</p>

<p>You may use up to 2 slip days on the checkpoint submission.</p>

</h2>
    

<p>If you submit the team confirmation form at the checkpoint, but opt out of working on the project at any point after that, you will be assessed a penalty of 1% on your final grade. This penalty is enforced given this is an optional group project, to ensure that students don’t exit groups midway through the project period after committing to it early. We don’t want your teammates to suffer! If you are unsure about whether you are planning to follow through on the project, discuss upfront with your team and only join a team if you are willing to do so.</p>

<p>The final project is intentionally open-ended. As such there is no “correct answer”, which means <strong>you are encouraged to discuss and share approaches</strong> <strong>and tips</strong> with students in this class. <strong>However, you may not directly cop</strong>y large amounts of written work or SQL queries that will be components of your final report.</p>

<p>You must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Cite any sources when using code that was not generated by your or your teammates.</li>
</ul>

<p>You may:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Share code snippets on the relevant Ed threads, especially if they are related to tasks indirectly covered in class, like installation of tools, using psycopg, etc.</li>
  <li>Use generative AI tools to ask high level questions, generate ideas and help debug code.</li>
  <li>Use generative AI tools to help <em>edit</em> your writing, catch typos, improve clarity, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>You must not:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Directly use generative AI tools to write portions of your written report.</li>
  <li>Copy entire queries from other students or online resources.</li>
  <li>Outsource your analysis to anyone other than members of your team.</li>
</ul>

</h2>
    

<p>Here are some tips for working in your project groups. Usually, the best way to resolve any concerns with your group members is through proactive, direct, and considerate communication!</p>

<p>Most of the below tips are based on the collective wisdom of Data Science final project courses:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Start a group chat and make sure everyone knows to check it regularly.</li>
  <li>Consider meeting in person rather than online: students have told us that this tends to be more productive and efficient, and more fun too.</li>
  <li>Don’t be afraid to reach out to course staff and come to office hours early if your group is struggling to set up systems or select/clean/load in data. You’ll likely be able to get more focused help at instructor <strong>content</strong> office hours.</li>
  <li>Even if you divide up the work, it’s often helpful to have all group members contribute to brainstorming, reviewing results, and discussing how best to write up the report.</li>
  <li>If you have concerns with your group members, communicate them earlier: don’t wait until the last minute! It’s much easier to resolve issues and improve collaboration early than the night before the deadline.</li>
</ul>

<details>
  <summary>Should I do the final project?</summary>

  <p>Because we have a final exam for all students this semester, we recommend that you only do this optional final project if you have the capacity and motivation in this upcoming month to work in a team and produce a good report and solid results.</p>

  <p>If you are worried about your midterm grade, come talk to us. We’ll recommend some tips for studying for the final exam. If you would like to include this project on your resume, go for it. This project page will be up past the end of the semester, so we recommend this as a reasonable personal project, say, over winter break, if that’s when you have more capacity.</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Can the final project lower my grade?</summary>

  <p>No. We will compute the maximum of both grading options in the class. Note that if you submit to the checkpoint but decide to opt out of the final project, you will be subject to a 1% grade deduction overall, relative to the situation where you didn't participate in the project at all. See the <a href="https://data101.org/sp25/syllabus/">Syllabus</a> for more information.</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>
    Can I be on a team of less than 3 people?
  </summary>

  <p>
    No.
  </p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>
    How do slip days work?
  </summary>

  <p>
    Each person may use up to <b>2 slip days</b> each on the checkpoint and the final report/repository submission. Slip days will be handled <b>individually</b> at the end of the semester. For example, if your team submits the checkpoint with 1 slip day and the final submission with 2 slip days, then each person gets a 3 slip day deduction from their total remaining slip days. This means that late penalties may be applied differently per team member.
  </p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>
    Can I get project help during office hours?
  </summary>

  <p>
    We can offer general tips during office hours, but we likely won't be able to help debug specific code.
