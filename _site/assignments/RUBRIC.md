### Scoring Guidelines
Each major section in the report will be 3-6 points.
The majority of the points will be awarded simply for putting in a strong team effort and making reasonable justifications.

- [ ] (N-1)/N points (e.g. 2/3, or 5/6) is the "default" assuming you answer all components
- [ ] The final point for each section: clear writing, _good_ decision making, and sound analysis
- [ ] Points will be taken off for excessive slopiness, lots of gen-ai writing
